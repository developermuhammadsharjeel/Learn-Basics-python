#there are many type of variables in python 
'''
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
In python we dont need to add variable type with variable (Like in  c++ we add type of variable with them int a=10; string name = "name"; )
'''
# we name variable with underscore _ and name only , we can use number at starting of variable name
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)


s='sharjeel'
print(s)

name= "HI GIt Hub Learners"
print(name)
